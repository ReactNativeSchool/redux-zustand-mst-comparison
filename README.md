A repo comparing [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), and [mobx-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome) in a React Native app.

You can choose an app by going to `App.tsx` and choosing whichever version you want to use. Each state framework exists in its own directory.
